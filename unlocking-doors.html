        <h2>Part 3: Unlocking Doors</h2>

        <p>
            In this challenge, you will add code that checks if the player has a
            key when they walk into a door. If they do, the door will be removed
            and the number of keys they are carrying will be reduced by 1.
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>When a player steps on a wall tile:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If they have 0 keys, display the door is locked and stop their movement</li>
                <li>
                    If they have at least 1 key
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove the door from the map</li>
                        <li>Reduce the keys the player is carrying by 1</li>
                        <li>Display a message stating the player unlocks the door</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Your message should be specific to your game. Feel free
            to adjust the message to meet your theme.
        </p>

        <p> When you have completed it, your project should work similar to the
            one below:</p>

        <h2>Hints</h2>

        <h3>Updating Door Condition</h3>
        <p>
            In your current project, you have an <code>if</code> statement in
            your code that prevents the player from moving through the door. 
            You can add multiple conditions to an if statement using the <code>and</code>
            keyword. The code below shows an <code>if</code> statement that checks if
            the player is touching a door <code>AND</code> has 0 keys. Can you update
            your code to do the same? If you're successful, you should be able to move
            through doors if you have at least 1 key.
        </p>

        <h3>Opening Doors</h3>

        <p>

            Next, you need to add code to your game that checks if the player
            has at least 1 key. This can be done using the greater than
            operator. More specifically you can use the code: <code>keys >
            0</code> which will be <b>true</b> if the <code>keys</code> variable
            is greater than 0.

        </p>

        <p>
            The code below is incomplete. Can you finish it?

        <h2>What's Next: </h2>
        <p>
            If all went well, you are now able to add doors and keys inside of
            your maze! Using these techniques, you could design a variety of
            additional elements for your game. Feel free to come up with your
            own ideas or, if you would like, you can use one or more of the
            ideas below:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Add an Exit: Add a tile to the game that, when it is reached
                displays the message "You win!"
            </li>
            <li>
                Button/Switches: When the player steps on a button, use
                <code>mset</code> to change the map. This could be used to
                create secret hallways, reveal keys, or even add traps to the
                maze!
            </li>
            <li>
                Portals: When a players steps on a portal, they are teleported
                to another part of the map!
            </li>
            <li>
                Timer: Add a count down timer to the game that is displayed at
                the top of the screen. When the timer reaches 0, display a "Game
                Over" message.
            </li>
        </ul>
