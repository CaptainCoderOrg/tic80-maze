        <h2>Part 3: Unlocking Doors</h2>

        <p>
            In this challenge, you will add code that checks if the player has a
            key when they walk into a door. If they do, the door will be removed
            and the number of keys they are carrying will be reduced by 1.
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>When a player steps on a wall tile:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If they have 0 keys, display the door is locked and stop their movement</li>
                <li>
                    If they have at least 1 key
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove the door from the map</li>
                        <li>Reduce the keys the player is carrying by 1</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>


        <p> When you have completed it, your project should work similar to the
            one below:</p>

        <h2>Hints</h2>

        <h3>Opening Doors</h3>

        <p>

            Next, you need to add code to your game that checks if the player is touching a door AND has at least 1 key.
            This can be done using the greater than operator. More specifically you can use the code: <code>keys >
            0</code> which will be <b>true</b> if the <code>keys</code> variable
            is greater than 0.

        </p>

        <p>
            The code below is incomplete. Can you finish it?

        <h2>What's Next: </h2>
        <p>
            If all went well, you are now able to add doors and keys inside of
            your maze! Using these techniques, you could design a variety of
            additional elements for your game. Feel free to come up with your
            own ideas or, if you would like, you can use one or more of the
            ideas below:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Add an Exit: Add a tile to the game that, when it is reached
                displays the message "You win!"
            </li>
            <li>
                Button/Switches: When the player steps on a button, use
                <code>mset</code> to change the map. This could be used to
                create secret hallways, reveal keys, or even add traps to the
                maze!
            </li>
            <li>
                Portals: When a players steps on a portal, they are teleported
                to another part of the map!
            </li>
        </ul>
