        <h2>Part 2: Collecting Keys</h2>

        <p>
            In this challenge, you will add code that detects when the player
            has stepped on to a key tile, removes the key tile from the map, and
            tracks the number of keys the player has collected.
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add at least one key to your maze</li>
            <li>The number of keys the player currently is visible at all times</li>
            <li>
                When the player steps on the key:
                <ul>
                    <li>The key is removed from the map</li>
                    <li>The player's key count increases</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p> When you have completed it, your project should work similar to the
            one below:</p>

        <h2>Hints</h2>

        <h3>Initialize a Keys Variable</h3>
        <p>
            In your current project, you initialize the start position of your player using the
            <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables at the start of the
            file. You will need to track the number of keys the player is
            holding. What would be a good name for your variable? In your game,
            what is the initial value?
        </p>

        <h3>Display the Number of Keys</h3>

        <p>

            To display the number of keys your player is currently carrying, you can use the
            <code>print</code> function. Be sure you add your code <b>AFTER</b> you
            have cleared the screen and drawn your map. For example, the following code
            displays the players current position in the top right corner of the screen:

        </p>

        <img src="imgs/print.png">

        <p>What should your text be? What position should it be displayed? What color should it be?</p>

        <h3>Collecting the Key</h3>
        <p>
            Using the <code>mget</code> function, you are able to get the id of
            a tile on the map. Similarly, there is an <code>mset</code> function
            that allows you to set the id of a tile on the map.

            The code below is an incomplete implementation of the key collection
            code. Can you finish it?
        </p>

        <h2>What's Next: </h2>
        <p>
            Now that your player is able to collect keys, you can turn your
            attention to unlocking the doors! In the next part of the challenge,
            you will write code that checks if the player has a key. If they do,
            the door will be removed from the map and the number of keys the
            player has will be reduced.
        </p>
