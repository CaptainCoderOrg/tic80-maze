        <h2>Part 1: Adding Doors</h2>

        <p>
            In this challenge, you will add code that prevents your player from
            moving through doors.
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add at least one door to your maze</li>
            <li>
                When the player attempts to move through the door they are stopped
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Your message should be specific to your game. If your
            "door" is a destructible crate <b>or</b> a closed portal, feel free to
            adjust the message to meet your theme.
        </p>

        <p> When you have completed it, your project should work similar to the
        one below:</p>

        <h2>Hints</h2>

        <h3>Doors are Walls</h3>
        <p>
            For this part of the challenge, you can treat doors as though they are walls. Below is the code that is used
            to prevent the player from moving through a wall tile:

        <h2>What's Next: </h2>
        <p>
            With locked doors in your maze, you are one step closer to being
            able to create interesting puzzles. In the next Part, you will be
            challenged to write code that not only detects when a player steps
            on a key, but will keep track of the number of keys the player has
            collected.
